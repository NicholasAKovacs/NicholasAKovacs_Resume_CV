I am a computational biologist graduating from Georgia Tech in December 2018 that is seeking a position that will give me the opportunity to continue diving deeper into genomics and machine learning while solving public health problems as a Genomics Analysis Postdoctoral Fellow at the CDC. In addition to my hard skills gained as a PhD candidate which included my dissertation that answered fundamental biological questions using the scipy stack, and coursework in genomics and computer science, I developed the following soft skills: team leading experience gained as a laboratory-course teaching assistant, mentoring experience through a graduate-undergraduate mentoring scholarship program, public speaking experience from presentations at international and domestic conferences, project management skills via providing computational analyses for five coworkers' projects during PhD candidacy, and written communication skills sharpened through academic journal article and grant writing.
