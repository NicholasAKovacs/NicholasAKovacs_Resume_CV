\begin{cvletter}

\lettersection{About Me}
I am a bioinformatics PhD candidate at Georgia Tech who had been approved by my advisor and committee to defend this coming Fall and has been offered a short, temporary postdoctoral position by my research adviser. I am a dual US and Hungarian citizen who did mostly lab work in my undergrad while working on my biochemistry BS, but has since worked at the interface of bioinformatics and cheminformatics. I very much enjoy travel, especially to East Asia where I have presented my research projects as oral and poster presentations in Vietnam and Japan I also conducted research in Taiwan for a summer after I was awarded a NSF grant that I applied to independently as the Principal Invesitgator. What I enjoyed most as a graduate student is writing code to analyze data, making visually-appealing scientific figures, presenting my work to diverse audiences, and teaching science, math, and technology to my colleagues. Please be sure to click on the many links in my resume so that you can see examples of my projects, code, presentations, and scientific writing.

\lettersection{Why ClearView?}
The white pages on ClearView's website concerning orphan dieseases, orphan drugs, and genetic therapy were of great interest to me. ClearView offers its employees the unique opportunity to bring their deep content knowledge in the life sciences to bear across a range of strategic business challenges, ultimately helping to shape the future of medicine and drug development. Partnering with over 125 companies, composed of over 140 employees, and its top ranking by Vault.com really make ClearView stand out as a scientific consulting company.

\lettersection{Why Me?}
My interdisciplinary background and interests have led me to pursue a career in biopharmaceutical business consulting. My interests and knowledge of proteomics, next generation sequencing, strucutral biology, and drug discovery would pair very well with the ClearViews projects concerning orphan diseases, orphan drugs, and genetic therapies. I am a people person, am very comfortable presenting, and love analyzing data to deliver compelling, scientific stories. My career aspirations have always been to work in an industrial setting or government organization, and as a fellow in Connect to ClearView I would gain exposure to the many different facets of scientific business consulting and learn more about the company so that I can make myself a more desireable candidate for a consulting position at ClearView once I am available to begin work in 2019.
