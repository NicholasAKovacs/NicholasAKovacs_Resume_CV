\vspace{-6.5em}

\lettersection{About Me}
I am a US citizen that will defend my bioinformatics PhD from Georgia Tech in October 2018. I have a BS in biochemistry and as a graduate student, have found that I love coding, doing data analyses, making figures, and presenting. My PhD dissertation concerns the atomic interaction network analysis of ribosomal structures from species across the tree of life, which led me to divulge evolutionary insights on the evolution of protein folding using computer science and statistics. I want to work at a medium-sized biotech company where I can wear many hats and work alongside interdisciplinary scientists so that I can continue growing as a computational biolgist and data scientist. 

\lettersection{Why Finch Therapeutics?}
Finch Therapeutics is a medium-sized biotechnology company at the interface of biology, drug-discovery, and data science. Finch Therapeutics has 114 employees, according to LinkedIn, that strive to develop drugs that intentially manipulate the microbiome in patients with gastrointestinal diseases. The data scientists at the company use machine learning to analyze metagenomic, clinical, and other biological datasets to propose new scientific hypotheses for the development of therapeutics. 

\lettersection{Why Me?}
The position of Computational Biologist I: Data Scientist sounds perfect for me since it would expose me to many facets of biology as I continue branching out into data science. I think I would be a very a good fit for this position for the following reasons:
