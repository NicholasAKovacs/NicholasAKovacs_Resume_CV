I am a computational biologist graduating from Georgia Tech in December 2018 that is applying for the position Research Scientist Comp/Informatics at the J. Craig Venter Institute so that I can continue diving deeper into computational genomics and structural bioinformatics while elucidating the links between molecular evolution, cellular metabolism, and ecosystem biogeochemistry. In addition to my hard skills gained as a PhD candidate which included my dissertation that answered fundamental biological questions using the scipy stack, and coursework in genomics and computer science, I developed the following soft skills: team leading experience gained as a laboratory-course teaching assistant, mentoring experience through a graduate-undergraduate mentoring scholarship program, public speaking experience from presentations at international and domestic conferences, project management skills via providing computational analyses for five coworkers' projects during PhD candidacy, and written communication skills sharpened through academic journal article and grant writing.
