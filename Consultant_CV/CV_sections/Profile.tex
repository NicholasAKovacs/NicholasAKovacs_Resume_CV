After successfully spearheading the transition of a theoretical project into a data-driven PhD thesis, a computational biologist graduating from Georgia Tech in December 2018 is seeking a position as a consultant at BCG or BCG Gamma. Relevant skills and experience for consulting: team leading experience gained as a laboratory-course teaching assistant, mentoring experience through a graduate-undergraduate mentoring scholarship program, public speaking experience from presentations at international and domestic conferences, project management skills via providing computational analyses for five coworkers' projects during PhD candidacy, and written communication skills sharpened through academic journal article and grant writing.
