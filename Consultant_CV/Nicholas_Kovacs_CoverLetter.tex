\lettersection{About Me}

\hspace{1em} Transitioning from an experimental, bench-top biochemist to a computational biologist during the first year of my graduate career is a transition I am very proud of because I became the go-to guy in my lab and department to analyze data which led to my involvement in a diverse range of projects spanning molecular biology, chemistry, data science, big data, and computer science. Even though my PhD project asked perhaps the biggest and most fundamental question of biology or even science---how did life originate and evolve---, my curiosity is unbounded and collaborating on projects fed my desire to better understand the world around me. My transformation into a computational scientist sparked my interest in entrepreneurship primarily via open-sourced software engineering which led me to enroll in the business course offered through my department titled "Concept-to-Market".

\hspace{1em} My first 3 years of graduate school I served part-time as a Teaching Assistant which gave me excellent management experience as I instructed classes of 8 senior undergraduates on how to conduct bench-top biochemistry. I later wrote and was subsequently awarded scholarships to mentor an undergraduate in the 2017 Petit Undergraduate Research Scholars Program and to conduct research in Taiwan with the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes scholarship awarded by the NSF. My writing skills are further exemplified by my soon to be 8 published research articles which total 144 citations, and my communications skills have been sharpened through poster and oral presentations at 7 academic conferences attended by scientists of disciplines ranging from ethics to astrophysics.

\lettersection{Why Boston Consulting Group \& Boston Consulting Group Gamma?}

\hspace{1em} I want to work on a multitude of diverse projects over the next few years. Being one of the "Big 3", BCG is a management consulting company with decades of experience and reaches into diverse industries. Industries such as biopharmaceuticals and healthcare immediately stand out to me as practices whose projects I would like to work on, but BCG's diverse clientele is very appealing since projects from diverse industries would allow me to explore my interests, grow my expertise, and allow me to satisfy my curiosity of how the world works. I am open to relocating to one of BCG's many offices throughout the US, but ask that my preferences on my application are considered first. My wife is Korean and in a couple years we would like to relocate to Seoul or Tokyo where I can continue working with BCG and BCG Gamma.

\lettersection{Why Me?}

\hspace{1em} "Act like the person you needed when you were younger" is a mantra I hold closely, since I continuously strive to become a better version of myself and I like helping people realize their potential. Combining my desire for fast-paced projects and helping people succeed with my love of research, working in teams, and presenting will make me a good consultant at BCG. My intense curiosity, desire to help others, and belief in empowering others through programming fits perfectly with what it means to be a consultant at BCG.
