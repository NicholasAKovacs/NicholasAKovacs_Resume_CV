# My Resume and CV
My resume is based off of a "Data Engineer" resume I found here on GitHub, this resume was based off of the 20-second resume. My CV is based off of awesome-CV which I also found here on GitHub.

Both of the are written in Latex. The class files of both the resume and CV have some stuff that I do not use in them that the original authors wrote, I will clean these class files up as I perfect my resume and CV.
