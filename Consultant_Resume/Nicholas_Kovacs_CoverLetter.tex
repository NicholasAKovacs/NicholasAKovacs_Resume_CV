\lettersection{About Me}

\hspace{1em} Transitioning from an experimental biochemist to a computational biologist during the first year of my graduate career is a transition I am very proud of because I became the go-to guy in my lab and department to analyze data which led to my involvement in a diverse range of projects spanning molecular biology, chemistry, and data science. My PhD project asked perhaps the most fundamental question of biology ---how did life originate and evolve---, but my curiosity is unbounded and collaborating on projects fed my limitless interests. My transformation into a computational scientist also sparked my interest in entrepreneurship which led me to contributing to open-sourced software engineering and enrolling in the "Concept-to-Market" business course offered through my department.

\hspace{1em} My first 3 years of graduate school I served part-time as a teaching assistant which gave me excellent management experience as I instructed classes of 8 senior undergraduates on how to conduct bench-top biochemistry. I later wrote and was subsequently awarded scholarships to mentor an undergraduate in the 2017 Petit Undergraduate Research Scholars Program and to conduct research in Taiwan with the 2017 East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes scholarship awarded by the NSF. My writing skills are further exemplified by my soon to be 8 published research articles which currently total 153 citations, and my communications skills have been sharpened through poster and oral presentations at 7 conferences attended by scientists of disciplines ranging from ethics to astrophysics.

\lettersection{Why McKinsey \& Co}

\hspace{1em} I want to work on a multitude of diverse projects over the next couple years as I develop an expetise. Being one of the "Big 3", McKinsey is a management consulting company with decades of experience. McKinsey's diverse clientele is very appealing as this would allow me to apply my data science, research, and communication skills to a diverse set of projects that would accelerate my learning. McKinsey is regarded as an excellent place to work according to many different metrics. Reviews from employees of the company love their intelligent and ambitous coworkers, breadth of projects, meaningful work, and emphasis on mentorship. I am very open to moving to moving within the US and hope to relocate to Seoul in a few years.


\lettersection{Why Me?}

\hspace{1em} "Act like the person you needed when you were younger" is a mantra I hold closely, since I continuously strive to become a better version of myself and I like helping people realize their potential. Combining my desire for fast-paced projects and helping people succeed with my love of research, working in teams, and presenting will make me a good data-driven consultant at McKinsey. I am not at all burned out from graduate school; I have become accustomed to long working hours. My intense curiosity, desire to help others, and belief in empowering others through problem-solving fits perfectly with what it means to be a consultant at McKinsey and I am available to begin work as early as January 2019 but can also work as a postdoc under my current advisor until summer 2019.
