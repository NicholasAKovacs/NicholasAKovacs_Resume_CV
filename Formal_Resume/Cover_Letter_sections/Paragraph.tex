Hello,


I am a bioinformatics PhD student at Georgia Tech who had been approved by my advisor and committee to defend this fall. My dissertation uses structural bioinformatics and machine learning to make predictions about the evolution of protein folding that are contained within the structure of the ribosome. I am a US citizen who did mostly lab work in my undergrad while working on my biochemistry BS, but has since worked at the interface of bioinformatics and cheminformatics. What I enjoyed most as a graduate student was analyzing data with python, making visually-appealing scientific figures, presenting my work to diverse audiences, and teaching the science and technology to my colleagues and undergrads. I am very confident in my scientific abilities and enjoy communicating science and technology with people of diverse backgrounds, but I am humble person who enjoys forming connections with people which is why the position of Application Scientist at ChemAxon is perfect for me.



I would very much like to move to Boston or San Diego for this position and would be thrilled if presented with the opportunity to work in Budapest in a couple years since I lived there many years ago and would love to go back.



Thank you in advance,

Nick
